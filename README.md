I built this project during a selection process for IBM

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## React project using the MARVEL API

<p align="center">In this project an interface was developed to display some comics from the MARVEL API</p>

This project is published here: https://marvel-next-psi.vercel.app/

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

The informations about endpoint of MARVEL API are here `service/api.ts`
You can change the numbers of comics in this file `service/api.ts`, default is 3

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
